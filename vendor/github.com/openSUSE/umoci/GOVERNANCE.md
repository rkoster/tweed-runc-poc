## Governance Model ##

umoci currently operates under a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) model. All
final decisions are made by the project owner (who is currently Aleksa Sarai).

When more maintainers join the project, the governance model will likely change
to some kind of consensus model -- but until such a change to the governance
model is made (and accepted by the BDFL), the BDFL will remain unchanged.

As an openSUSE project, there is an "escape hatch" governance in the form of
the [openSUSE Board][openSUSE-board]. In incredibly rare (and extreme) cases
where a decision about this project is asked of the openSUSE Board, they can
override decisions made by the BDFL (with the understanding that the openSUSE
Board's main goal is to reduce friction between parties, not to act as a
general appellate court). This "escape hatch" is invalidated if umoci ceases to
be an openSUSE project.
