## Code of Conduct ##

As umoci is part of the openSUSE project, we adopt the openSUSE Code of
Conduct. This is enshrined in the [openSUSE Guiding
Principles][openSUSE-principles], in particular:

> [We value] respect for other persons and their contributions, for other
> opinions and beliefs. We listen to arguments and address problems in a
> constructive and open way. We believe that a diverse community based on
> mutual respect is the base for a creative and productive environment enabling
> the project to be truly successful. We don't tolerate social discrimination
> and aim at creating an environment where people feel accepted and safe from
> offense.

In case of an violation of these principles (or any reasonable interpretation
of the above principles), you may report it [to the maintainers](/MAINTAINERS).
If the maintainers are unable to handle this situation (or one of the
maintainers is responsible for a code of conduct violation), then the issue can
be escalated to the [openSUSE Board][openSUSE-board] who will be able to deal
with the violation.

Both the maintainers and the Board assume all necessary rights to handle
violations in a reasonable and proportionate manner. However, violations that
happen outside of the openSUSE project and community *may* be decided to be
outside the jurisdiction of this Code of Conduct (depending on the
circumstances -- and, as above, the Board can be escalated to in case of
disagreement).
